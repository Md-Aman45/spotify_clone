## üöÄ Running Locally 

Install dependencies 
```bash
npm install 
# or 
yarn 
```

Run development server 
```bash
npm run dev 
# or 
yarn dev 
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Click any song to start playback. The player appears at the bottom.

## üê≥ Docker Containerization 

This app uses Docker multi-stage build for optimized image size.

Build Docker image 
```bash
docker build -t spotify-clone . 
```

Run container 
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 spotify-clone 
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions CI/CD 

Automates: 
- Building the Docker image on push to main 
- Pushing the image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) 
- Tagging the image with: 
  - Commit SHA 
  - Branch name 
  - latest for default branch 

Prerequisites: 
- Enable GitHub Actions in your repository 
- Ensure GHCR permissions are configured (default GITHUB_TOKEN works) 

Example workflow snippet: 

```yaml
name: Build & Push Docker 

on: 
  push: 
    branches: 
      - main 

jobs: 
  build-and-push: 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
    steps: 
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx 
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2 
      - name: Log in to GHCR 
        uses: docker/login-action@v2 
        with: 
          registry: ghcr.io 
          username: ${{ github.actor }} 
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} 
      - name: Build & push Docker image 
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5 
        with: 
          context: . 
          push: true 
          tags: ghcr.io/Md-Aman45/spotify_clone:latest 
```

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube) 

Prerequisites: 
- Minikube 
- kubectl 

Steps: 

Start Minikube: 
```bash
minikube start 
```

Update the Docker image in k8s/deployment.yaml: 
```yaml
image: ghcr.io/Md-Aman45/spotify_clone:latest 
```

Apply Kubernetes manifests: 
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/ 
```

Check deployments and pods: 
```bash
kubectl get deployments 
kubectl get pods 
```

Access your app using NodePort: 
```bash
minikube service spotify-clone --url 
```

This will give a URL like http://192.168.xx.xx:31162. You can open it in your browser or share it with others in your local network.

Optional - Port Forwarding: 
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/spotify-clone 3000:80 
```

Then access via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Cleanup: 
```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/ 
minikube stop 
```

If you want, I can also **add screenshots of the music player and visualizer** to make the README look professional for GitHub.  

Do you want me to add that?
